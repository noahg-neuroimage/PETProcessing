    - Below the threshold, we have a simple linear interpolation.
    - Above the threshold, we fit a line to the data.
    
    When the object is instantiated, we automatically find the interpolation and the fit. Then, we can simply call the
    `calc_blood_input_function` function to give us blood input function values at any time.
