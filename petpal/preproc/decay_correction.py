"""Decay Correction Module.

Provides functions for undo-ing decay correction and recalculating it.

Todo:
    * Refactor arguments (and half-life retrieval) once decorators are implemented to translate paths to ANTsImages.
    * Handle BIDS keys more formally (i.e. this currently reads/writes decay factors from the key 'DecayFactor' instead
        of the BIDS-required 'DecayCorrectionFactor).'

    This function expects to find decay factors in the .json sidecar file, or the metadata_dict, if given. If there are
    no decay factors (either under the key 'DecayFactor' or the BIDS-required 'DecayCorrectionFactor') listed, it may
    result in unexpected behavior. In addition to returning an ANTsImage containing the "decay uncorrected" data, the
    function writes an image to output_image_path, unless it is passed as 'None'.

    Args:
        input_image_path (str): Path to input (.nii.gz or .nii) image. A .json sidecar file should exist in the same
             directory as the input image.
        output_image_path (str): Path to output (.nii.gz or .nii) output image. If None, no image will be written.
        metadata_dict (dict, optional): Metadata dictionary to use instead of corresponding .json sidecar. If not
            specified (default behavior), function will try to use sidecar .json in the same directory as

    This function will compute frame reference times based on frame time starts and frame durations (both of which
    are required by BIDS. These reference times are used in the following equation to determine the decay factor for
    each frame. For more information, refer to Turku Pet Centre's materials at
    https://www.turkupetcentre.net/petanalysis/decay.html

    .. math::
        decay\_factor = \exp(\lambda*t)

    where :math:`\lambda=\log(2)/T_{1/2}` is the decay constant of the radio isotope and depends on its half-life and
    `t` is the frame's reference time with respect to TimeZero (ideally, injection time).

    Note: BIDS 'DecayCorrectionTime' is set to 0 (seconds w.r.t. TimeZero) for the image. If this assumption doesn't
        hold, be wary of downstream effects.

    Args:
        input_image_path (str): Path to input (.nii.gz or .nii) image. A .json sidecar file should exist in the same
