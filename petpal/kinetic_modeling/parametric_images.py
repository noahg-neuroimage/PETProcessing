This module provides functions and a key class, :class:`GraphicalAnalysisParametricImage`, for 
graphical analysis and creation of parametric images of 4D-PET scan data. It heavily utilizes 
:mod:`numpy` for data manipulation and assumes the input as 4D PET images along with other required
inputs.

The :class:`GraphicalAnalysisParametricImage` class encapsulates the main functionality of the 
module, and encompasses methods for initializing data, running and saving analysis, calculating
various properties, and handling parametric image data.

        Performs graphical analysis of PET parametric images and generates/updates the slope and
        intercept images.

        Important:
            This method scales the PET image values by the ``image_scale`` argument. This quantity
            is inferred from the call to :meth:`run_analysis` which uses a default value of 1/37000
            for unit conversion of the input PET image from Bq/mL to μCi/mL.

        This method uses the given graphical analysis method and threshold to perform the analysis
        given the input Time Activity Curve (TAC) and 4D PET image, and updates the slope and 
        intercept images accordingly. PET images are loaded from the specified path and multiplied
        by ``image_scale`` to convert the image into the proper units. Then, the parametric images 
        are calculated using the specified graphical method and threshold time by explicitly
        analyzing each voxel in the 4D PET image.

        Args:
            method_name (str): The name of the graphical analysis method to be used.
            t_thresh_in_mins (float): The threshold time in minutes.

        Returns:
            None

        Raises:
            Exception: An error occurred during the graphical analysis. This could be due to an
            invalid method name or incorrect inputs to the method.
