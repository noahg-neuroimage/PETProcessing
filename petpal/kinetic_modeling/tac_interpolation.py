"""
This module provides classes for time-activity curve (TAC) interpolation for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
data. It enables the resampling of data evenly with respect to time, which is particularly useful when performing
convolutions with respect to time. We use :py:class:`scipy.interpolate.interp1d` for the interpolation.

The module comprises two classes: :class:`EvenlyInterpolate` and :class:`EvenlyInterpolateWithMax`.

The :class:`EvenlyInterpolate` class takes in TAC times and values and a specified delta time, :math:`\\Delta t`, to
resample data by interpolating TACs evenly with respect to time.

The :class:`EvenlyInterpolateWithMax` class extends the functionality of :class:`EvenlyInterpolate` by modifying the
calculation of delta time, :math:`\\Delta t`, to explicitly sample the maximum value of the TAC.

Example:
    In the proceeding example, we shall use the two classes to resample a fake TAC. For better visualization, we shall
    plot the resampled TACs shifted in the y-direction.
